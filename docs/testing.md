# Testing and measurement

## Static gates

Every change should pass:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
cargo test
cargo test --features stats
cargo build --release
```

The suite covers FEN, compact moves, attack edges, legal start moves, hash restoration, randomized make/unmake, three Perft families, evaluation, mate/stalemate/draw search, stop signaling, TT mate normalization, time budgets, SEE, UCI parsing, and an executable UCI smoke test.

Randomized invariant testing uses 64 deterministic seeds and up to 96 legal plies each, then unmakes every move and compares the exact original position.

## Perft gates

Required release commands:

```bash
target/release/neyrang perft 5
target/release/neyrang perft-fen "r3k2r/p1ppqpb1/bn2pnp1/3PN3/1p2P3/2N2Q1p/PPPBBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 1" 4
target/release/neyrang perft-fen "8/2p5/3p4/KP5r/1R3p1k/8/4P1P1/8 w - - 0 1" 5
```

Expected nodes are 4,865,609; 4,085,603; and 674,624 respectively.

## Deterministic benchmark

The benchmark searches five fixed positions at depth 5. Nodes and checksum must be identical for the same engine revision. Time and NPS are machine- and load-dependent; use `scripts/bench.sh` for repeated runs and compare medians under similar thermal/background conditions.

NEYRANG 0.1.0 ARM64 release baseline on the development Apple Silicon host:

- positions: 5
- depth: 5
- nodes: 448,136
- checksum: `a4b453e8ce750456`
- five-run median: 282 ms and 1,587,507 NPS

All five runs produced the same node count and checksum. This is a deterministic regression baseline, not a cross-machine performance promise.

## Complete-game smoke evidence

On 2026-08-29, the native ARM64 release was run through python-chess 1.11.2 against the official native ARM64 Stockfish 18 binary (SHA-256 `4d77c4aa3ad9bd1ea8111f2ac5a4620fe7ebf998d6893bf828d49ccd579c8cb0`). Five fixed openings were paired with colors reversed for ten games. NEYRANG used depth 3 and Stockfish depth 1.

- 10/10 games completed
- 0 crashes, hangs, illegal moves, or unfinished games
- 5 checkmates and 5 threefold repetitions
- NEYRANG-perspective W/D/L: 4/5/1

The deliberately unequal depth settings make this a protocol/legality stress test only. It is not an Elo estimate or evidence that NEYRANG is stronger than Stockfish.

Two additional paired-color games used `go movetime 20` with a 2 ms move-overhead setting. Both completed after 36 plies without an illegal move, crash, or hang. An interactive infinite-search test returned `bestmove` 0.10 ms after `stop` in the final measured run. These are smoke measurements, not guaranteed latency bounds.

The paired games are retained as an importable PGN at `examples/neyrang-vs-stockfish-smoke.pgn`. The reproducible harness and En Croissant workflow are documented in [the integration guide](en-croissant.md).

## Strength testing

Run `scripts/test-match-config.sh` before comparative testing. Use `scripts/regression.sh` for paired parent-versus-candidate games, `scripts/match.sh` for fixed-size or node-limited comparisons, and `scripts/sprt.sh` for longer patch decisions. The runners expose a fixed opening seed and record binary/Git/opening/fastchess checksums, complete PGN telemetry, logs, and metadata beside the requested PGN.

Keep engine settings equal, reverse colors, use an audited balanced opening suite, retain PGNs, and report games/W/D/L/score/Elo confidence intervals. The eight bundled openings are only a smoke/development set. The frozen 0.2.0 development configuration is recorded in [the baseline document](development/0.2.0-baseline.md), and feature outcomes belong in [the experiment ledger](development/experiments.md).
